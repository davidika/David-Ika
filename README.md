## Introduction 

This Project applies various methods to a dataset to clean, transform, visualise and report on observations.

The chosen dataset is titled "Funding Successful Projects on Kickstarter" and can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects), uploaded by user [Lathwal](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007)

The dataset was released by [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), a crowdfunding company that connects community investors with start-up projects in an 'all-or-nothing' fashion: The user sets a goal for their project, and if it falls short by even $1, zero funding is attained.

The data was initially released from the perspective of the company, in that it had an interest of predicting the success of a project. There is also, however, information that potential creators may find useful.

# Project 2 - Predicting successful outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns
## Introduction

Project 2 continues from Project 1 (above) and observes the same dataset.

Whilst Project 1 explored and visualised the data, Project 2 aims to address the initial business objective set by Kickstarter: to help predict whether a project will be successfully funded. Classification and clustering methods will be used to achieve this.
