* Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects).

### Description 

This Project applies various methods to a dataset to clean, transform, visualise and report on observations.

The chosen dataset is titled "Funding Successful Projects on Kickstarter" and can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects), uploaded by user [Lathwal](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007)

The dataset was released by [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), a crowdfunding company that connects community investors with start-up projects in an 'all-or-nothing' fashion: The user sets a goal for their project, and if it falls short by even $1, zero funding is attained.

The data was initially released from the perspective of the company, in that it had an interest of predicting the success of a project. There is also, however, information that potential creators may find useful.
