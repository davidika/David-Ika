# - Introduction 

This Project will apply various methods in to a dataset to clean, transform, visualise and report on observations.

Chosen dataset is titled "Funding Successful Projects on Kickstarter" and can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects). Uploaded by user [Lathwal](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007)

The dataset was released by company, [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), who connects community investors with start-up projects in an 'all-or-nothing' fashion: The user sets a goal for their project, and if it falls short by even $1, zero funding is attained.

Data was initially released to help early prediction of whether a project will be successfully funded, but also provides other information that potential authors may find useful.
